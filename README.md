# My First Repository

This is all about me. My name is Carlo Baldassini and my background is Italian. My grandparents came from Italy to Canada, along with some extended family and have been here ever since. I have 2 siblings, a sister and a brother, and a dog. I live with my brother, mother, and father as my sister has moved out and lives on her own now. I hope you have learned a lot about me!
